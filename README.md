# AddGPT

A Chrome Extension to make chatting more efficient with chatgpt.

## Cause

This extension was necessity driven. I often wanted to see my previous chats and ChatGPT replies to perfect my current text but to do so, you have to scroll all over to that specific chat or reply. It was very irritating(or maybe I'm lazy ðŸ˜›).

There comes The Saviour AddGPT. Now all the previous chats and replies are at your finger tips, you don't have to scroll all the way to heaven.

## Installation

1. Download the repo.
2. Run `npm install` then `npm run build`
3. Load the `dist` folder on Chrome Extensions.

## Usage

Open chatgpt. Start chatting or open an older chat. <br>
Click on the "AddGPT" bar on right. <br>
You'll see all your texts.
Click on the green button to get the chatgpt reply of it. <br>
You can collapse it by clicking the icon beside "AddGPT" logo on the texts page.

Now it is a super minimal version. Feel free to share your thoughts and feature. I'll love to hear them.
